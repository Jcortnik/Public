    <h1>Slide 1: Imerys Mexico PCC Growth Strategy</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Strategic opportunities to expand PCC asset utilization in Mexico</li>
        <li>Focus on pharma growth, mixed mineral slurries, and calcium citrate market penetration</li>
        <li>Pyramid structure: Problem → Insight → Recommendation</li>
        <li>Prepared for executive decision-making</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>Slide 2: The Problem - Underutilized PCC Capacity in Mexico</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Imerys operates calcium carbonate assets globally, including in Mexico, but PCC production faces regional market saturation in traditional sectors like paper and plastics</li>
        <li>Current utilization below optimal levels due to slowing demand in core industries, risking profitability and asset efficiency</li>
        <li>Need to diversify applications to counter economic slowdowns and leverage Mexico's strategic location for North American markets</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>Slide 3: The Problem - Emerging Market Pressures</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Global PCC market growth at 4-5% CAGR, but competition intensifying in low-value segments</li>
        <li>Mexico's PCC asset exposed to supply chain vulnerabilities and regulatory shifts in environmental standards</li>
        <li>Opportunity cost of not penetrating high-margin niches like pharma and specialty chemicals</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>Slide 4: Insight - Pharma Sector Growth Potential</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>PCC serves as a key excipient in pharmaceuticals, with market demand rising due to aging populations and health supplements</li>
        <li>North American pharma market expanding at 4.8% CAGR, offering premium pricing for high-purity PCC</li>
        <li>Imerys' existing high-purity minerals align with pharma-grade requirements, enabling quick market entry</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>Slide 5: Insight - Mixed Mineral Slurries Opportunities</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Mixed slurries combine PCC with other minerals for applications in oilfield drilling, coatings, and industrial fluids</li>
        <li>Market for mineral slurries growing with energy sector demands, where Imerys' expertise in customization provides competitive edge</li>
        <li>Mexico's proximity to U.S. oilfields reduces logistics costs, boosting margins on slurry products</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>Slide 6: Insight - Calcium Citrate Market Penetration</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Calcium citrate derived from PCC reactions, used in supplements and food fortification, with market growing at 3.7% CAGR to $1.2B by 2031</li>
        <li>Mineral companies like Imerys can supply feedstock PCC, capturing value in downstream processing</li>
        <li>Untapped potential in health-conscious markets, where purity and sustainability differentiate offerings</li>
    </ul>
